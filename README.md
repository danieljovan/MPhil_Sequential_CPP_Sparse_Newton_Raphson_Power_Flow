# MPhil_Sequential_CPP_Sparse_Newton_Raphson_Power_Flow
This code shows a C++ implementation of the NR load flow method, including:  
- formation of sparse admittance and Jacobian matrices, 
- computation of real and reactive power equations,
- formation of the linear system of equations
- solution of the resultant sparse linear system using an iterative Krylov subspace method (Preconditioned Stabilized Bi-conjugate Gradient method)
